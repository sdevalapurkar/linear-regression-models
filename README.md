# Linear Regression Models

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

Here, we are experimenting with three different algorithms to train linear regression models: solving normal equations, batch gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.

## The Normal Equation

Solving for w using the following equation:
